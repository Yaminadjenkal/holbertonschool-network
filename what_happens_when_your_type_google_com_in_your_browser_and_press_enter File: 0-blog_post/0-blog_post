1️⃣ Figuring Out Where Google Lives (DNS Lookup)
Your browser doesn’t magically know where Google is. It has to ask the Domain Name System (DNS) to translate <www.google.com> into an IP address, like 142.250.190.78.

If your computer has seen this site recently, it already remembers the address.

Otherwise, the request gets sent to a series of DNS servers that work together to find Google’s IP.

2️⃣ Setting Up a Connection (TCP/IP Handshake)
Now that your browser knows where Google is, it needs to say hello and establish a connection.

This happens with a three-step handshake:

Your computer sends a SYN (Hey, can we talk?).

Google replies with SYN-ACK (Sure, let’s do it!).

Your computer responds with ACK (Great, let’s go!).

This ensures the connection is reliable, so no data gets lost.

3️⃣ Passing Through Security Checks (Firewalls)
Before reaching Google, your request may go through firewalls designed to protect against hackers, malware, and suspicious activity.

Your own computer’s firewall makes sure nothing harmful comes in.

Google’s firewalls filter bad traffic, stopping attacks before they reach their servers.

4️⃣ Making Sure It’s Secure (HTTPS & SSL/TLS)
Since you typed https://, your browser starts a secure handshake with Google using SSL/TLS encryption.

This ensures that your data remains private, and no one (like a hacker on public Wi-Fi) can steal it.

The browser checks Google’s SSL certificate to confirm you’re not talking to a fake version of Google.

5️⃣ Handling Millions of Users at Once (Load Balancer)
Google serves billions of requests every day, so it doesn’t rely on just one server.

Instead, your request goes through a load balancer, which decides which of Google’s many servers will handle it.

This prevents slowdowns and makes sure Google doesn’t crash from too much traffic.

6️⃣ Web Server Handles Your Request (Nginx or Apache)
Once Google’s load balancer picks a server:

The web server (Nginx or Apache) looks at your request.

If you’re asking for something simple (like an image or homepage), it sends it directly.

If you’re searching for something, it forwards the request to the application server.

7️⃣ Application Server Does the Heavy Lifting
Now, the application server gets to work.

It processes what you’re asking for (e.g., a Google search).

It interacts with databases, retrieves results, and figures out what to send back to you.

8️⃣ Database Finds the Information You Need
Google’s database stores everything—from search indexes to your saved preferences.

The application server asks the database to retrieve relevant information.

The database sends back search results, user history, or whatever you need.

9️⃣ Sending the Response Back to You
Google’s web server takes the database response and packages it into an HTML page.

Your browser processes the page, loads images, styles it with CSS, and runs JavaScript.

Finally, the Google homepage appears, or you see your search results!

The Crazy Part?
This entire process takes place in fractions of a second! Your request has traveled across the world, been processed by multiple servers, and returned to you almost instantly.
